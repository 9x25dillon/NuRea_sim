# CCL Integration Summary

## Overview
The Categorical Coherence Linter (CCL) has been successfully integrated into the CarryOn MVP project, providing advanced code analysis capabilities for detecting potential issues and improving code quality.

## What CCL Does

### Core Functionality
- **Categorical Analysis**: Builds a light categorical model of Python code
- **Coherence Probes**: Tests mathematical properties like idempotence, commutativity, and associativity
- **Entropy Analysis**: Identifies high-entropy, low-coherence code zones
- **Ghost Detection**: Ranks functions by "ghost likelihood" based on coherence metrics

### Mathematical Properties Tested
1. **Idempotence**: f(f(x)) == f(x)
2. **Commutativity**: f(x, y) == f(y, x) for binary operations
3. **Associativity**: f(f(x,y), z) == f(x, f(y,z))
4. **Pipeline Coherence**: f∘g vs g∘f composition testing
5. **Stability/Sensitivity**: Small input perturbations shouldn't wildly diverge

## Integration Points

### 1. Server API Endpoints
- **`POST /v1/tools/ccl-analyze`**: Run CCL analysis on specified path
- **`POST /v1/tools/ccl-quick`**: Quick CCL scan of core project files
- **Enhanced `/v1/tools/status`**: Now includes CCL in features list

### 2. Electron Desktop UI
- **New CCL Section**: Dedicated panel for code analysis
- **Path Input**: Specify which code to analyze
- **Analyze Button**: Run full CCL analysis with configurable parameters
- **Quick Scan Button**: Rapid analysis of core project files

## Usage Examples

### API Usage
```bash
# Analyze specific file
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/tools/ccl-analyze \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"path":"server/app/retrieval/vector_index.py","samples":100,"seed":42}'

# Quick scan of core files
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/tools/ccl-quick
```

### Standalone Usage
```bash
# Analyze a file
python ccl_standalone.py server/app/retrieval/vector_index.py

# Start CCL server
python ccl_standalone.py --serve

# Generate report
python ccl_standalone.py server/app/ --report analysis.json
```

### Desktop App
1. Open the CarryOn MVP desktop application
2. Navigate to the "Code Analysis (CCL)" section
3. Enter a path to analyze (relative to project root)
4. Click "Analyze Code" for full analysis or "Quick Scan" for rapid check
5. View results in the output panel

## Technical Features

### Security
- Path validation ensures analysis only runs on project files
- No arbitrary file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Performance
- Configurable sample sizes for analysis depth vs. speed
- Efficient entropy calculations using Shannon entropy
- Optimized value generation for testing

### Extensibility
- Modular design allows easy addition of new coherence tests
- Configurable parameters for different analysis scenarios
- JSON output format for programmatic integration

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Utility Functions**: Entropy calculation, deep equality, value generation
- **Simple Functions**: Mathematical function analysis
- **Integration**: Real project file analysis
- **Error Handling**: Exception cases and edge conditions

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run CCL test suite
python test_ccl.py

# Run as part of setup
./setup.sh
```
